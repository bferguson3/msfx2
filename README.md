# MSFX2

Tool for making PSG sound effects.

Current progress:<br>
+Generates frequency-correct tones, but the mixing is off (try it on hardware before committing to a certain sound)<br>
+Support for all 8 envelopes<br>
+Playback and .wav generation<br>
+ASM export is functional<br>

-Waveforms are perfect square waves, not "rounded" square waves like the MSX/2 chips actually produce.<br>

I think I've abandoned this for now. It's fully functional but tweaking the waveform generation for mixing gave me a giant headache so I just made a quick tool in BASIC instead.
