Current progress:<br>
+Generates tone-correct and (mostly) amplitude correct sound for 3 channels<br>
+Support for all 8 envelopes<br>
+Playback and .wav generation<br>

-No asm export<br>
-Noise/mix doesn't work<br>
-Waveforms are perfect square waves, not "rounded" square waves like the MSX/2 chips actually produce.<br>
